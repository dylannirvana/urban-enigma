#Dashboard

Seems primarily concerned with layout. Since there is not "master-layout" in the scaffold, this seems likely.

The layout is NOT responsive as it is, but I think it should be. The UI is currently rigid. This is a larger discussion about developing perhaps a more modern looking User Interface.

The overall styles are kind of mixed in. There probably should be a main.scss (if we settle on SASS), or similar, including a variables.scss file.

Of particular interest in this folder however, is the text-editor.html and text-editor.js files. This is a template in the application and gets called from profile.
