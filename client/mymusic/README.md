#MyMusic

music-upload.html is currently the upload controller, under the template name, musicUpload. music-upload.html.tpl looks like an template scaffold from a PHP generator, possibly Smarty. The music-new-song.html was the previous controller.

This is common throughout this project. File substitution, duplication may be common. The project is not yet DRY.
